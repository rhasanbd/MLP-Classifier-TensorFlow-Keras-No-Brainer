Here the largest probability is 0.51 which indicates that the predicted label should be \"7\". However, for the class \"4\", the probability is also very high, i.e., 0.49. For this type of scenarios, although the predict_classs() method would return the label of the class with the largest probability, the predict() method would allow us to learn the uncertainty associated with the prediction.\n",
