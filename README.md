# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier

In this notebook, we build a MLP classifier using the **TensorFlow (2.0) Keras API**. The MLP is a Dense or Fully-Connected (FC) neural network. 

We use the MLP classifier to perform multi-class classifcation on the **MNIST handwritten digits** dataset.


## Regularization Techniques

We employ the following regularization techniques.
- Dropout regularization
- Early Stopping regularization


Another regularization technique is the **L1 or L2 norm** based regularization. We did not use this technique. We provided commented out codes for this regularization.


## Learning Curves
To help understand a model's performance (underfitting/overfitting, etc.), we plot a model's training & validation accuracy/loss with repect to the epochs.
